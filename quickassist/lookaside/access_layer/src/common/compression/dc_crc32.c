 *     Calculates CRC-32 checksum for given Buffer List
 *
 *     Function loop through all of the flat buffers in the buffer list.
 *     CRC is calculated for each flat buffer, but output CRC from
 *     buffer[0] is used as input seed for buffer[1] CRC calculation
 *     (and so on until looped through all flat buffers).
 *     Resulting CRC is final CRC for all buffers in the buffer list struct
 *
 * @param[in]  bufferList      Pointer to data byte array to calculate CRC on
 * @param[in]  consumedBytes   Total number of bytes to calculate CRC on
 *                             (for all buffer in buffer list)
 * @param[in]  seedChecksums   Input checksum from where the calculation will
 *                             start from.

 * @retval Cpa32U              32bit long CRC checksum for given buffer list
